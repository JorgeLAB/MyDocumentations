			<header><h2>Introduction</h2></header>
			<p> Ruby is interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Developed for Yukihiro Matsumoto in Japan, around 90's.</p>
			<p> Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smallltalk, Eiffel, Ada, Basic and Lisp. His typing is strong and dynamic. Interestingly, it is one of the few languages that were born outside the US-Europe axis that have achieved enormous commercial success. Ruby borned to one language expressive, very easy to read and understood. Facilitating the development and maintenance in the systems written that her.As ruby is a <strong>interpreted language</strong>, an interpreter must be installed on your machine, before to execute any program.
			<p><h3>Ruby Philosofy:</h3>
			<blockquote cite=''>
				"Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They think, 'By doing this, the machine will run fast. By doing this, the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will something something something.' They are focusing on machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines. We are the masters. They are the slaves."
			</blockquote> <i>- Matsumoto citation</i>

			<header><h2>Interpreters</h2></header>
			<p> Before the language Ruby became popular existed only one interpreter available that Matsumoto created in C. It was a simple interpreter, without any memory management so much complicated. Without modern features of the interpreters like compilation in executate time.( <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/95635/what-does-a-just-in-time-jit-compiler-do'>JIT</a>)</p>
			<p>Down here are some well-known interpreters:

				<ul>
					<li>JRuby</li>
					<li>IronRuby</li>
					<li>Rubinius</li>
					<li>RubySpec</li>
					<li>Ruby Enterprise Edition</li>			
				</ul>

			<header><h2>RubyGems</h2></header>
			<p> The Gems can be seen as libraries that reusable others codes ruby. RubyGems is a management system the packages, being flexible and efficient.One of the must popular gems is <strong>Rails</strong>.

			<header><h2>My First Ruby Program</h2></header>
			<p> By convencion, Ruby source files have the <strong>.rb</strong> file extension. The Ruby coding convention states that file/directory name is lower case of class/module name with .rb extension. For example, flashlight class has name flashlight.rb.
			<p>You will create one new file and write the following code:
			<h2> Comments </h2>
			<div>	
				<ol>
					<li>puts 'Hello World'</li>
					<li>print 'Hello World'</li>
					<li>p 'Hello World'</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<p><strong>Tip:</strong>"Code layout is pretty much up to you; indentation is not significant (but using two-character indentation will make you friends in the community if you plan on distributing your code)."
